# Questions for Platform Engineering — Proto-Hub + VWR Integration

> **Date:** 2026-04-04
> **From:** Crucible team (Pratik + agents)
> **Priority:** High — blocking Fire TV demo

## Context

We've built Proto-Hub (Foundry), a game launcher that replaces the Hub for Crucible/Bifrost games. It's deployed to CloudFront at `protohub-dev.volley.tv` and renders correctly inside VWR on Fire TV — the carousel loads, game tiles display, hero images show. But **D-pad input doesn't work**.

## Root Cause (identified via source code analysis)

**BrowserIpc requires same-origin.** The `BrowserIpcConnection` class in `@volley/browser-ipc` checks `this.#trustedOrigins.has(event.origin)` in its message handler. When Proto-Hub at `protohub-dev.volley.tv` sends a handshake to VWR at `game-clients-dev.volley.tv`, VWR silently drops it because the origins don't match.

The regular Hub works because it's at `game-clients-dev.volley.tv/hub` — **same origin** as VWR at `game-clients-dev.volley.tv/vwr`. The handshake succeeds because `window.location.origin` is in `trustedOriginDefaults`.

### Evidence from Fire TV logs

```
VWR → Native Shell: BrowserIpc.connect ✓ (same origin: https://localhost)
Proto-Hub → VWR: BrowserIpc.connect ✗ (Timed out — different origin)
```

The "ready" event works fine because it uses `postMessage(event, "*")` with wildcard origin and VWR checks the message payload's `source` field, not `event.origin`.

## Our Proposed Fix

Deploy Proto-Hub to `game-clients-dev.volley.tv/protohub/` (same S3 bucket as Hub). We have a volley-infra PR (#2139) to grant S3 write permissions on `volley-game-clients-dev/protohub/*`.

## Questions

### 1. Is same-origin the only way?

Is there a way to add `protohub-dev.volley.tv` to BrowserIpc's trusted origins without deploying to the same domain? The VWR config has `trustedDomains` — does that feed into BrowserIpc's `trustedOrigins` set?

### 2. Can we share the game-clients S3 bucket?

Our PR #2139 on volley-infra adds S3 PutObject on `volley-game-clients-*/protohub/*` to the `crucible-ci` IAM role. Is there any concern with Proto-Hub deploying to the same bucket as the Hub? We're scoped to the `protohub/` prefix only.

### 3. Is there a VWR config option for trusted BrowserIpc origins?

We noticed VWR auto-adds `hubUrl` origin to trusted domains. Does this also add it to BrowserIpc's trusted origins? If so, it should be working — what are we missing?

### 4. Should Proto-Hub use a different VWR integration path?

We're currently loading Proto-Hub as `hubUrl` (not `launchUrl`). Is this the right approach for a Hub replacement? Or should we use a different VWR config field?

### 5. `BrowserIpc.connect` timeout is 1 second — is that configurable?

The Platform SDK's BrowserIpc connect times out after ~1 second. On Fire TV's WebView, cross-origin postMessage might be slower. Is there a way to increase the timeout?

## What We've Already Fixed

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Session ID crash | Changed `gameId: "proto-hub"` → `"hub"` |
| Platform error modal | Treat platform errors as non-fatal |
| Loading screen stuck | Removed `isPlatformReady` gate on carousel |
| VWR ready timeout | SDK emits ready automatically with `gameId: "hub"` |
| Amplitude flag | Added device to vwr-enabled flag |
| S3 AccessDenied | CloudFront distribution at protohub-dev.volley.tv |
| Base path 403 | Changed from `/hub/` to `/` |
| Invisible tiles | Generated colourful AI artwork for game tiles |

## What Works

- Proto-Hub loads inside VWR Hub iframe ✓
- Carousel renders with game tiles ✓
- Hero images display fullscreen ✓
- Ready event received by VWR ✓
- D-pad events reach native shell ✓

## What Doesn't Work

- **D-pad events don't reach Proto-Hub iframe** ✗
- BrowserIpc handshake from Proto-Hub to VWR silently dropped ✗
- Without BrowserIpc, VWR can't forward key events to the iframe ✗

## Updated Understanding (from VWR Release Process doc)

We've read the VWR Release Process Notion doc. We understand that:
- VWR's RPC is **designed** to work cross-origin (that's its purpose — "circumvents any cross-origin issues between iframe and parent")
- VWR runs the RPC **server**, Hub iframe runs the RPC **client**
- The Platform SDK should detect VWR mode and use RPC implementations
- `BrowserIpc.connect` IS being attempted (the SDK is in RPC client mode) but the server isn't responding

So the question becomes: **why isn't VWR's BrowserIpc server responding to Proto-Hub's handshake?** Is it an origin whitelist issue in the BrowserIpc server, or something else?

Since VWR's RPC is explicitly designed for cross-origin, the same-origin deploy might not be the right fix. There may be a simpler configuration issue we're missing.
